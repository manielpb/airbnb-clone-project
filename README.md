Technology Stack
Django: A high-level Python web framework used to build the backend server and RESTful APIs. It provides the core structure for the application (models, views, URL routing, admin interface) and handles security, database interaction, and server logic.

PostgreSQL: A powerful, open-source relational database system. It is used as the primary data storage for the application, securely storing and managing all structured data like user accounts, content, and transactional information.

GraphQl: A query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. It allows the frontend client to request exactly the data it needs in a single request, preventing over-fetching or under-fetching of data common in REST APIs.

    Feature Breakdown
    * User Management: This feature allows users to securely register, log in, and manage their                         profiles. It forms the foundation of the platform by protecting user                            data and providing a personalized experience for both guests and hosts.
    * Property Management: This enables hosts to create, update, and manage detailed listings                            for their properties, including descriptions, photos, prices, and                               availability. It is the core inventory of the platform, providing                               guests with options to browse and book.
    * Boooking System: This system handles the entire lifecycle of a reservation, from checking                         availability and calculating costs to confirming and managing bookings.                         It is the primary transaction engine of the platform, facilitating the                          core service of connecting guests with hosts.


    API Security
        * Authentication
        Measures: Implementation of a robust system using hashed and salted                             passwords (with algorithms like bcrypt), JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for stateless session            management, and secure password reset flows.
        Why it's Crucial: This is the first line of defense. Strong authentication ensures              that only legitimate users can access their accounts, preventing unauthorized access            to personal data, financial information, and private messages.

    * Authorization:
          Measures: Implementing role-based access control (RBAC) and object-level permissions            (e.g., ensuring a user can only edit their own property listings, profile, and                  bookings).
          Why it's Crucial: Authorization defines what authenticated users are allowed to do.             It is critical for preventing users from accessing or modifying data that isn't                 theirs (e.g., a guest canceling another user's booking or a host deleting a review),            which protects user privacy and data integrity.
    * Rate Limiting
          Measures: Implementing limits on how often an API endpoint or authentication route              can be called from a single IP address/user account within a specific time window               (e.g., using Django Ratelimit or Django REST Framework's throttling classes).
          Why it's Crucial: This protects the application from Denial-of-Service (DoS) and                brute-force attacks. It prevents bots from overwhelming the login system with                   countless password guesses or from scraping the entire property database, ensuring              service availability for legitimate users.
      *Payment Security
          Measures: Never storing raw credit card details. Using a certified payment processor            (e.g., Stripe, Braintree) and relying on their APIs and tokens (like PaymentIntent              IDs) to handle transactions. Ensuring all payment flows are over HTTPS.
          Why it's Crucial: This is non-negotiable for handling financial data. A breach here             would lead to direct financial fraud, devastating legal liability, and a complete               loss of user trust. Compliance with standards like PCI DSS is mandatory.

      CI/CD Pipeline
          CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment/Delivery) is an automated               process that helps developers reliably build, test, and deploy software.
          Continuous Integration (CI): The practice of automatically building and testing code            every time a developer pushes a change to the shared repository (e.g., on GitHub).              This ensures new code integrates smoothly and doesn't break the existing application.
          Continuous Deployment/Delivery (CD): The automated process of deploying the                     successfully tested code from the CI stage directly to a staging or production                  server. This allows for frequent and reliable releases.

      * Why are they important for this project?
        1.  Improves Code Quality & Stability: Automated testing in the CI pipeline catches                 bugs and regressions before they reach users, leading to a more stable and reliable             booking platform.
        2.  Enables Rapid & Safe Deployments: CD automates the deployment process, allowing you             to release new features, security patches, and bug fixes quickly and consistently               with minimal manual effort, reducing the risk of human error.
        3. Increases Team Productivity: Automation frees developers from manual testing and                deployment tasks, allowing them to focus on building new features. It also provides             immediate feedback on their code changes.
